                <p>Whether you call it Refinishing, Reglazing, or Resurfacing, there are two (2) basic types of coatings used in this line of work, and we are pleased to offer both. The first is an Epoxy based coating, and the second is an Acrylic Urethane based coating. The materials are quite distinct, and the differences are detailed below.</p>

            	<h2>What's the Difference?</h2>
                <p>The Big difference between cheap & high quality coatings is the number of chemical bonds holding the molecules together. The higher the cross-link density, the higher the overall film durability and coating life span. Ours High Performance coating is specifically designed for the Bathtub Resurfacing. This fully linked system offers our customers the most long-term value, as compared to low-link coatings used by other area companies. </p>

            	<h2>4 hour cure</h2>
                <p>Our  4 HOUR CURE coating means you can use your bathtub the SAME DAY, which we know consumers appreciate. No long delays and return trips to clean up saves you time and money too. Add to that is the fact that this fully linked Aliphatic Acrylic urethane offers a 4H pencil hardness and is rated 10 in scuff and mar tests which translates into one tough coating that looks great and will last and last. Its so tough that it's used in Marine, Aerospace and Industrial enviroments, and will stand up to your homes use too.  At Bath Magic, we prefer to use the best materials on the market.</p>

        	<h2>Surface Preparation</h2>
            <p>The most important step in renovating your tub or sink is in the preparation process... please do not rush through this step. Just as much or preferably MORE time and energy should be spent in the preparation of the surface than the actual painting!<br>

            Priming of your tub, tile, or sink surface is optional based on the quality of the surface. If scores and imperfections exist – use either our Gray (#50) or White (#55) epoxy primer kit (sides A & B) on your surface first. This will help to get the surface smooth and ready for top-coating. 
            <br>
            Always (if you're going directly to top coating or using a primer) clean and scrub the surface to be painted thoroughly with soap and water and an abrasive pad or scrub brush to remove any grease, grime, soap build-up, or loose scale.  Make any necessary tub repairs before beginning to paint.  Remove tub fixtures and mask off as necessary.
            <br>
            Whether priming or not, a light to medium sand paper should be used on the cleaned, scrubbed surface to “feather the surface”, and remove minor scores and imperfections.   If heavier surface issues remain, priming of the surface will be necessary. After any sanding, be sure to re-clean the surface removing any and all sanding dust. A clean rag, lightly dampened with Epoxy Reducer #500 (or a high-grade lacquer thinner) should be used to wipe down the surface just prior to application of primer or top coat.

            	<h2>General Care</h2>
                <p>
First, do not touch the reglazed surface until the designated curing time. Do not open windows, or turn on air fans, as this may cause dirt and debris to fall into the fresh reglazing material, resulting in sharp points forming in the surface. If debris does fall into the tub, do not attampt to remove, as these will wear off over the first months use.

Water drip bags have been placed over the water spout, to protect against water dripping onto the freshly reglazed surface. Should the bags begin to fill, the customer must replace the bags, or turn off the water flow.

At the conclusion of the drying time, carefully remove any protective paper that was left, and discard. Replace the drain screen, and overflow stopper.

Immediately recaulk around the DRAIN LIP, and the TUB RIM. Also, if it was not possible for our technicians to remove the overflow linkage, recaulk around the overflow plate also. Failure to apply and maintain a proper caulk seal may lead to water damage, and cause the reglazed material to peel. DO NOT USE SELF ADHESIVE CAULKING STRIPS. </p>

            	<h2>Prevent Slips and Falls</h2>
                <p>
Bathmats with suction cups are the single most damaging thing you can use on your reglazed tub. Mats, pillows, spas, etc., that adhere with suction cups should never be used. Under certain circumstances, they can pull material off the reglazed surface. Use of these items on your reglazed may lead to an expensive repair, and the voiding of your warranty. To prevent slips and falls, we strongly recommend one of our permanent non-slip mats. For information on these, go to the link below. </p>

            	<h2>Damage, chips, stains, and scratches</h2>
                <p>
                To prevent stains from forming on your reglazed bathtub, do not use bleach, oils, or dyes. Avoid storing objects directly on the surface, especially metal cans which may form rust stains. If rust develops, attempt to remove with specialized cleaners such as Iron Out or Whink. Never hang garments, which could bleed stains, on your bathtub.
<br>
DO NOT lay or store soap, sponges, cloths, bottles or any objects on the finish at any time! Purchase a shower rack instead.<br>
IF YOU CHIP OR SCRATCH YOUR REGLAZED SURFACE. TRY ONE OF OUR TOUCHUP KITS. THERE IS NO MIXING REQUIRED, SO IT'S SIMPLE TO USE, AND PROVIDES LONG LASTING RESULTS. WE MATCH FROM COLOR PLATES PROVIDED BY THE MANUFACTURERS. COLOR VARIATIONS BY THE MANUFACTURER, AGING AND ROOM LIGHTING MAY AFFECT THE MATCH. IT'S THE NEXT BEST THING TO A SERVICE CALL!!! </p>

            	<h2>Safe Cleaning Products</h2>
                <p>
Generally avoid cleaning your tub for the first 30 days with anything other than a mild dish soap and a soft sponge. After 30 days, clean your tub as required with a NON-AEROSOL soap scub removing cleaner. We strongly recommend Tilex Bathroom Cleaner or Kaboom. Avoid harsh or abrasive cleaners, aerosol cleaners, acids, bleaches, and scratch pads. Do not use DOW SCRUBBING BUBBLES or SOFT SCRUB as these can dull out the luster on your reglazed surface. </p>
